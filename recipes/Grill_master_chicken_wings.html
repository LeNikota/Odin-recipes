    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled wing recipe is always a hit! I grill them up before a party and keep them hot in a low oven. I
        always use Frank's RedHot sauce. It's got lots of flavor and isn't too spicy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Wings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare wings: Combine chicken wings, soy sauce, and Italian dressing in a large resealable plastic bag; 
            coat chicken wings with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4
            hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in hot pepper sauce and soy sauce until
            combined. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken wings from marinade and pat dry; discard any remaining marinade. Cook on the preheated grill,
            turning occasionally, until chicken is browned and no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place grilled wings in a large bowl. Pour butter sauce over wings; toss until well-coated. </li>
    </ol>
