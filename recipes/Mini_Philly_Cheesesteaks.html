    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Miniaturized sandwiches don't usually float my boat, as they're almost always not as good as the full-sized
        versions. But this mini Philly cheesesteak recipe captures everything I love about the classic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <ls>2 tablespoons butter, or as needed</ls>
        <ls>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</ls>
        <ls>1 cup cold milk</ls>
        <ls>2 ounces shredded provolone cheese, or more to taste</ls>
        <ls>1 pinch ground nutmeg</ls>
        <ls>1 pinch cayenne pepper</ls>
        <ls>salt to taste</ls>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mini Cheesesteaks</h3>
    <ul>
        <ls>1 (12 ounce) skirt steak</ls>
        <ls>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</ls>
        <ls>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</ls>
        <ls>¼ cup water</ls>
        <ls>⅓ cup diced onion</ls>
        <ls>⅓ cup diced sweet peppers</ls>
        <ls>2 baguettes, or as needed, cut into 48 1/2-inch thick slices</ls>
        <ls>¼ cup shredded provolone cheese, or as needed</ls>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line baking sheets with aluminum foil.</li>

        <li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk flour into hot butter and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is pale and flour taste cooks off, about 1 minute. Whisk milk into flour mixture until mixture is hot and thickened, 3 to 6 minutes. Add provolone cheese, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and salt; stir until cheese is completely melted. Set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Make mini cheesesteaks: Season steak with salt and black pepper.</li>
        
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak in hot oil, turning occasionally, until meat is slightly firm and pink on the inside, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate.</li>
        
        <li>Return the skillet to heat and pour in water; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour liquid from the skillet over steak. Cool steak to room temperature; dice meat and place meat and accumulated juices from the plate into a large bowl.</li>
        
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; sauté onion and peppers in hot oil until softened and slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and peppers into beef in the bowl; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li>Spread bread slices out on the prepared baking sheets and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Flip slices over so the oiled sides face downward. Spread cheese sauce generously onto each slice. Spoon beef mixture on top. Sprinkle with provolone cheese.</li>
        
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
