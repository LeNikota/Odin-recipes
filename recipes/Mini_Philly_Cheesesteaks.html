            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Miniaturized sandwiches don't usually float my boat, as they're almost always not as good as the
                full-sized
                versions. But this mini Philly cheesesteak recipe captures everything I love about the classic.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line baking sheets with aluminum foil.</li>

            <li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk flour into hot butter and cook,
                whisking
                constantly, until mixture is pale and flour taste cooks off, about 1 minute. Whisk milk into flour
                mixture
                until mixture is hot and thickened, 3 to 6 minutes. Add provolone cheese, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and
                salt;
                stir until cheese is completely melted. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Make mini cheesesteaks: Season steak with salt and black pepper.</li>

            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak in hot oil, turning
                occasionally,
                until meat is slightly firm and pink on the inside, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate.</li>

            <li>Return the skillet to heat and pour in water; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food
                off of
                the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour liquid from the skillet over steak. Cool steak to room
                temperature; dice meat and place meat and accumulated juices from the plate into a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; sauté onion and peppers in hot oil until
                softened
                and slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and peppers into beef in the bowl; season with
                salt
                and pepper.</li>

            <li>Spread bread slices out on the prepared baking sheets and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
                Flip slices over so the oiled sides face downward. Spread cheese sauce generously onto each slice. Spoon
                beef mixture on top. Sprinkle with provolone cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. </li>
